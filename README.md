Scalable - Computing Project 3 : Satellite Based Ship Safety prediction using NDN (Name Data Networking)

Every process should be run on seperate Pis

Step 0: Install the required packages using python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt. The statsmodels package can take a long time to install, for me it took around 4 hours to install on the pi, so be patient.

Step 1: Run the Satellite.py python3 Satellite.py to start training the model, the program waits for the user to input. The user has to wait until the router is started and the training is complete. When the training is done, the satellite will print out a "waiting..." message, at which point any key press will activate it. It's best to activate the satellite after all 4 buoys are started, but that's not required.

Step 2: Run Router.py python3 router.py --name router1 to start listening to the broadcasts.

Step 3: Run all 4 buoys on separate PIs

python3 buoy.py --name A1

python3 buoy.py --name A2

python3 buoy.py --name B1

python3 buoy.py --name B2

Step 4: Run the ship.py python3 Ship.py --name ship1 --loc B1 and it automatically sends the interest to the Satellite every 10 seconds (simulation - 1 hr).

The satellite predicts the weather for the next 5 hrs and returns the best location the ship needs to be. This will be printed in the ship window, as either moving to: or staying in: and the location.
